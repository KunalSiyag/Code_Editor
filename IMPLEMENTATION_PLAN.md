  rules:
    - name: "Critical vulnerabilities block"
      condition: "severity == 'critical'"
      action: "BLOCK"
    - name: "High risk needs review"
      condition: "risk_score > 0.8"
      action: "MANUAL_REVIEW"
  ```
- [ ] Build policy parser
- [ ] Implement decision engine:
  - Aggregate signals: AI findings + ML score + scan results
  - Apply policy rules
  - Generate verdict: AUTO_APPROVE | MANUAL_REVIEW | BLOCK
- [ ] Create override mechanism (manual approval)

**Deliverable**: End-to-end analysis pipeline (Scan → AI → ML → Policy → Decision)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Week 1-2 Risks
- **Data collection takes too long** → Use pre-labeled dataset (Kaggle, academic)
- **API setup issues** → Start with FastAPI template

### Week 3-4 Risks
- **Claude API rate limits** → Implement exponential backoff, batch requests
- **Blockchain deployment fails** → Use Hardhat local network for demo

### Week 5-6 Risks
- **GitHub Actions permissions** → Use personal repo, enable all permissions
- **Integration bugs** → Add logging at every step

### Week 7-8 Risks
- **Deployment issues** → Test deployment early (Week 6), keep local backup
- **Demo day failures** → Record backup video, have local environment ready

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Commit daily** - Push progress to GitHub every day
2. **Demo-driven development** - Always keep something working for demos
3. **Parallel work** - Frontend and ML can be done simultaneously
4. **Use mocks** - Don't wait for backend, use mock data in frontend
5. **Document as you go** - Write README sections as you complete features
6. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until the end
7. **Ask for help early** - Don't spend more than 2 hours stuck
